## About Sweet condo

The objective is to create a system that allows supporting the operation of a condominium management company that manages condominiums in different buildings. The company manages the individual accounts of each condominium owner, taking into account each condominium's installments, common expenses and payments made by each condominium owner. However, the system is intended to provide information relating to each registered condominium owner. The company must also manage its employees, which in addition to employees who work in the office, may include cleaning staff, gardeners, plumbers, etc. You must also manage contacts with service providers, such as elevator maintenance or security companies. Every month (or quarter) balance sheets must be issued to be sent to condominium owners so that they can pay their respective shares. At the end of the year, the financial report for each building managed and the budget for the following year must be generated. It must be possible for each condominium owner to search for information relating to their building in the system (balance sheets, accounts report, budget, etc.). However, a given condominium owner (or other unauthorized person) must not be allowed to consult information relating to another building that is not their own.
